🕵️‍♂️ Fake Job Detection
📌 Overview

Fake job postings are a rising problem on online platforms, often used to scam job seekers by stealing personal information or money. This project aims to build a machine learning model that can classify job postings as real or fake, helping users identify fraudulent listings.

The system uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze job descriptions and metadata, and then applies classification algorithms to detect patterns that indicate fraud.

🚀 Features

Preprocessing of text data (cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal).

Feature extraction using TF-IDF / Word Embeddings.

Machine learning models for classification (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, etc.).

Evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Simple interface to input job details and check if they are real or fake.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, NLTK / SpaCy, Matplotlib / Seaborn

Machine Learning Models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Naive Bayes (can be extended to Deep Learning)

Dataset: Kaggle – Fake Job Postings Dataset

⚙️ Installation & Setup

Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/fake-job-detection.git
cd fake-job-detection


Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Run Jupyter notebook or the app:

jupyter notebook
# or
python app.py

📊 Results

Achieved around XX% accuracy with [best model].

Balanced evaluation with precision and recall to minimize false predictions.

🔮 Future Improvements

Use Deep Learning (LSTM, BERT) for better text understanding.

Build a web app for users to upload job details and get instant predictions.

Deploy the model using Flask/Django + Streamlit or on cloud platforms.
